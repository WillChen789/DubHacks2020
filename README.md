# DubHacks2020
Poor sitting posture can lead to back pain and decreased productivity, especially when people are stuck working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We present ImPosture, a web-based slouch detection application that leverages computer vision and pose estimation to alert users when posture is sub-optimal. This application is lightweight and can run in-browser. DubHacks 2020 hackathon project.

# Run Instructions
cd into `app`, then run `npm install`, then `npm start`. You can view ImPosture in any browser (mostly tested with Chrome) at localhost:3000
